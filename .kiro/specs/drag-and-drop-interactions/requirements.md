# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the drag-and-drop feed organization system and pull-to-refresh functionality for FlowRSS. These features will enhance user experience by providing intuitive, gesture-based interactions for organizing feeds and refreshing content. The drag-and-drop system will allow users to reorganize feeds between folders and categories, while pull-to-refresh will provide a mobile-friendly way to update feed content.

## Glossary

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Drag-and-Drop Feed Organization

**User Story:** As a FlowRSS user, I want to drag feeds between folders and categories, so that I can quickly reorganize my feed collection without using context menus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses and holds on a Feed_Item for 200 milliseconds, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL initiate a drag operation
2. WHILE a drag operation is active, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL display a visual indicator showing the Drag_Source being moved
3. WHILE a drag operation is active, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL highlight valid Drop_Targets with a visual indicator
4. WHEN the user drags a Feed_Item over a valid Drop_Target, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL display a hover state on the Drop_Target
5. WHEN the user releases a Feed_Item over a valid Drop_Target, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL move the Feed_Item to the Drop_Target within 300 milliseconds
6. IF the user releases a Feed_Item over an invalid location, THEN THE FlowRSS_System SHALL animate the Feed_Item back to its original position within 200 milliseconds
7. WHEN a Feed_Item is successfully moved, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL persist the new organization to IndexedDB within 500 milliseconds
8. WHEN a Feed_Item is successfully moved, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL display a success notification for 2 seconds

### Requirement 2: Visual Feedback During Drag Operations

**User Story:** As a FlowRSS user, I want clear visual feedback during drag operations, so that I understand where I can drop feeds and what will happen.

4. WHEN the user presses Enter while in drag mode, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL move the Feed_Item to the selected Drop_Target
5. WHEN the user presses Escape while in drag mode, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL cancel the drag operation and return focus to the original Feed_Item

### Requirement 4: Pull-to-Refresh on Article List

**User Story:** As a mobile FlowRSS user, I want to pull down on the article list to refresh feeds, so that I can easily get the latest content with a familiar gesture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Article_List is scrolled to the top and the user performs a Pull_Gesture, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL display a refresh indicator
2. WHILE the Pull_Gesture distance is less than Refresh_Threshold (80 pixels), THE FlowRSS_System SHALL display a "pull to refresh" message
3. WHEN the Pull_Gesture distance exceeds Refresh_Threshold, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL display a "release to refresh" message
4. WHEN the user releases the Pull_Gesture after exceeding Refresh_Threshold, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL trigger a feed refresh operation
5. WHILE refreshing, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL display a loading spinner for the duration of the refresh operation
6. WHEN the refresh operation completes, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL hide the refresh indicator within 300 milliseconds
7. IF the refresh operation fails, THEN THE FlowRSS_System SHALL display an error message for 3 seconds

### Requirement 5: Pull-to-Refresh Visual Feedback

**User Story:** As a mobile FlowRSS user, I want clear visual feedback during pull-to-refresh, so that I understand the gesture progress and state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHILE performing a Pull_Gesture, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL display a progress indicator showing pull distance as a percentage of Refresh_Threshold
2. WHEN pull distance reaches 50% of Refresh_Threshold, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL animate the refresh icon with a rotation effect
3. WHEN pull distance exceeds Refresh_Threshold, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL change the refresh icon color to indicate ready state
4. WHILE refreshing, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL display an animated spinner with smooth rotation
5. WHEN refresh completes successfully, THE FlowRSS_System SHALL display a checkmark icon for 500 milliseconds before hiding

### Requirement 6: Touch and Mouse Support

**User Story:** As a FlowRSS user on any device, I want drag-and-drop and pull-to-refresh to work with both touch and mouse input, so that I have a consistent experience across devices.
