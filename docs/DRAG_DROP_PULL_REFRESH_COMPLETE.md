## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current MVP Scope
- No undo/redo (can be added later)
- No multi-select drag (single feed at a time)
- No keyboard navigation (mouse/touch only)
- No auto-scroll during drag (manual scroll needed)

### Not Bugs, Just Scope
These are intentional omissions for MVP to ship faster. They can be added in Phase 2 if users request them.
