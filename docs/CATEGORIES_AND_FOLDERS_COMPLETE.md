# Categories and Folders Implementation - Complete!

## Overview

Implemented a dual organization system:
1. **Categories** - Auto-grouping based on feed category (Technology, News, Fediverse, etc.)
2. **Folders** - User-created custom organization

Both are collapsible for a clean, organized sidebar.

## How It Works

### Automatic Categorization
When feeds are added from curated packs, they're automatically assigned a category:
- Feeds from "Tech News" pack → Technology category
- Feeds from "Fediverse - Mastodon" pack → Fediverse category
- Feeds from "AI & ML" pack → AI category

### Manual Organization
Users can:
1. Create folders for custom grouping
2. Move feeds from categories into folders
3. Feeds in folders don't appear in categories
4. Feeds without folders appear in their category

### Priority
1. **Folders first** - User-created folders appear at top
2. **Categories second** - Auto-grouped feeds appear below
3. **Uncategorized last** - Feeds without category at bottom

---

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `src/components/sidebar/category-list.tsx` - Category grouping component

### Modified Files
2. `src/components/sidebar/folder-list.tsx` - Simplified to only show folders
3. `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` - Added both folder and category lists

---

## User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Browse by Category
1. User subscribes to "Tech News" pack
2. Feeds automatically appear under "Technology" category
3. User clicks category to expand/collapse
4. Feeds are organized automatically

### Workflow 2: Create Custom Folder
1. User clicks "+" next to "My Folders"
2. Creates folder "Work"
3. Moves relevant feeds into folder
4. Feeds disappear from categories
5. Organized by user preference

### Workflow 3: Mixed Organization
1. Keep some feeds in categories (auto-organized)
2. Move important feeds to folders (manual)
3. Best of both worlds
