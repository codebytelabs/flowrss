# RSS Feed Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "All Articles" View Not Working ✅

**Problem**: The "All Articles" view showed "No articles yet" even when articles existed in the database.

**Root Cause**: The view was calling `getUnreadArticles()` which only returned unread articles. When users clicked on articles, they were marked as read and disappeared from the view.

**Solution**: 
- Added new `getAllArticles()` method to database operations
- Updated `article-list.tsx` to use `getAllArticles()` for the "All Articles" view
- Now shows all articles (both read and unread) in chronological order

**Files Changed**:
- `src/lib/db/schema.ts` - Added `getAllArticles()` method
- `src/components/feed/article-list.tsx` - Updated to use new method

- ❌ Anthropic Blog: DNS resolution failure (ENOTFOUND)
