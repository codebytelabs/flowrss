## üìù Notes

### Design Decisions
- **Folders vs Categories:** Folders are user-created, categories are auto-assigned
- **Multi-category:** Feeds can appear in multiple categories for better discoverability
- **Context menu:** Primary organization method (drag-and-drop is V2)
- **Fediverse:** Unique differentiator, prioritize in marketing

### Technical Debt
- Drag-and-drop library not yet integrated (planned for RTM)
- Unread count calculation needs optimization
- Full-text extraction deferred to V2
- AI features require API integration (V3)

### User Feedback Priorities
1. Organization system (folders/categories)
2. Fediverse integration
3. Reading experience
4. Performance
5. Mobile experience
